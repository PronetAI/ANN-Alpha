## ANN Alpha 2.0
We have created a Neural network that now runs on microcontrollers! This can be customized per your settings, such as input and output nodes, as well as the acceleration of the learning and the error margin. You can also customize the desired input training sets and the targeted output sets as well.
### ANN Alpha 2.0.1
There is a more improved documentation for people to use and understand the code
